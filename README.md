# Week 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## Overview
This week focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python and how to apply them in small projects.

## Topics Covered
- Classes & Objects
- Constructor (__init__)
- Instance & Class Variables/Methods
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Composition vs Inheritance

## Mini Project
**Library Management System**
- Classes: Book, Library, User
- Features: Add/remove books, issue/return books, track availability
- Concepts used: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

## Key Takeaways
- OOP makes code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.
- Start with class design before writing methods.
- Use small projects to practice and reinforce concepts.
- Use classes for structured modeling.
- Understand when to use inheritance vs composition.
- Practice real-world mini-projects to strengthen concepts.
